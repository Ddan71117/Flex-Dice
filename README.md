  ## Description

   Flex-Dice is a single-player dice game where players compete against an AI opponent in a fun, fast-paced version of the popular game Left, Right, Center (LRC). The objective is simple: roll the dice, manage your chips, and be the last player with remaining chips to win. Flex-Dice combines the classic mechanics of LRC with the challenge of playing against a dynamic AI, offering an exciting experience that tests both your luck and strategy. Whether you're playing for fun or aiming to beat the AI, Flex-Dice guarantees an engaging and unpredictable gameplay experience!
